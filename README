We have created a user interface through which one can manage a database with the following tables:

> employees - contains the employee's information such as full name, birthdate, hire date and gender.
> salaries - the employee's salary for a certain period
> dept_emp - the employee's department for a certain period
> dept_manager - managers of each department for a certain period
> departments - the existing departments 
> titles - the title of each employee for a certain period

The login window appears with the execution of the program and at the same time the connection
to the database begins. According to the user's credentials on the database, the menu differs.

The entire menu, which is visible only to the administrator consists of the following options:

> Bonus Table with submenu: Create Table, 
							Delete Table

> Edit table with submenu:  New Employee
							Remove Employee
							New Department
							New Department Manager
							New Department Employee
							Insert title for new employee
							Insert salary for new employee

> Views with submenu : 	Create Employees View
						Create Bonus View
						Employees View
						Bonus View


> Search with submenu : Employee's Birthday
						Salary Check
						Department Manager
						Employees on each department
						Employee with title and manager position
						Sum on this year's bonus
						Count of female department managers
						Female department managers

> Exit button


Given the baseline code, we created the following classes:

> create the frame and the menu bar : MvbView.java

> create and delete a new table : BonusModel.java , BonusController.java
  The Bonus table uses the Employees and Salary tables to calculate an annual bonus
  that the company will give to their employees.
  
> insert and delete data in/from tables : EditModel.java , EditController.java
  
> execute static and dynamic queries : SearchModel.java , SearchController.java
  
> create and project views : ViewModel.java, ViewController.java
